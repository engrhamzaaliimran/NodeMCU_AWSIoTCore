# NodeMCU AWS Subscription
In order to create a connection with AWS. We first need to flash certificates provided by AWS into NodeMCU's Flash memory.
## Installation of Drivers 
You need to install drivers for FTDI chip cp2101 present on NodeMCU. You can get them to from the following link
https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers 

## Flashing the Certificates
Three certificate files are used to establish a connection with AWS Cloud. Following are the files
  - xxx-ca.pem
  - xxx-certificate.pem 
  - xxx-private.pem.key
### Conversion to DER Format 
To flash to NodeMCU, we need to convert the certificate files to DER format. The OpenSSL utility is used for this purpose. Next is the syntax for running conversion commands.
```sh
$ openssl  x590 -in InputFileName.pem â€“out OutputFileName.der -outform DER
```
Windows users can use the Ubuntu App from Microsoft Store for this. OpenSSL can be installed by running
```sh
apt install openssl
```
## ESP8266 FileSystem Uploader
To flash DER files, we need a to install plug-in named "ESP8266 FileSystem Uploader" to Arduino IDE. Following is the link to the repository

https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin

Clone the above repository. Create a folder at the sketchbook location of IDE and name it "tools". Copy the contents of repository in it. You can find the path at Preferences submenu is inside File Menu. As shown below

Restart the Arduino IDE. Connect your NodeMCU with the computer and select the COM port on Arduino IDE. Click on "ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload" inside the Tools Menu in Arduino IDE. As shown below.

It will start uploading certificates to NodeMCU. This may take up to 2 Minutes.  
## NodeMCU AWS Subsciption Code
The file containing the code is named as "NodeMCU_subs_shadow.ino.ino". You need to make a few changes in it according to your setup. Following are the changes needed

- const char* AWS_endpoint = "XXXXXXX.amazonaws.com"; Update it to your own address here
- client.subscribe("$aws/things/RPI3/shadow/update"); Update it to your own custom topic
- File cert = SPIFFS.open("/cert.der", "r"); Update cert.crt with your file name
- File private_key = SPIFFS.open("/private.der", "r"); Update with your file name
- File ca = SPIFFS.open("/ca.der", "r"); Update with your file name
- const char* ssid = "XXX-AP2"; Update to your Network SSID
- const char* password = "XXX-AP2"; Update to your Network Password
- #define led1 14 Update to the GPIO pin you want to use for Red LED
- #define led2 12 Update to the GPIO pin you want to use for Blue LED
- #define led3 13 Update to the GPIO pin you want to use for Green LED
